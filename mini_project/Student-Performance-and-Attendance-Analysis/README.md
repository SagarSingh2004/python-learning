# Student-Performance-and-Attendance-Analysis
This project analyzes student academic performance and attendance data to understand how attendance influences overall performance. Using NumPy, Pandas, and data visualization libraries, the dataset was cleaned, processed, and transformed to derive meaningful insights.
The goal is to:
1.	Calculate total and percentage marks.
2.	Derive attendance percentages.
3.	Classify students based on performance.
4.	Identify students with low attendance and highlight top performers.
5.	Provide visual insights into the data.
